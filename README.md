To show all that I have learned from Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA), The incubator Hub 

### PROJECT TITLE:
LITA CAPSTONE DATASET

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Data Analysis is to show key insights in the Sales Performance of a company

### DATA SOURCES
The Primary source of data used is LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx

### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](www.micosoft.com)
1. For Data cleaning
2. For Analysis
- SQL- Structured Query Language: For querying data
- Power BI [Download here](www.microsoft.com)
1. For Data visualisation
- Github: Portfolio building

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
I performed the following actions
1. Data inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This helps to give answers to unanswered questions of the organisations.
1. What are the total sales for each product?
2. What is sum of sales for each region?
3. What are the sales of the company per month?

### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where I talk about the functions and codes I used when using the tools for data analysis
 - E.g
''' SQL
    select * from [dbo].[Sales data]
'''

### DATA SUMMARY
 I used Microsoft Excel to give summary of my data. This will help the organisation in making effective decisions and prevent wasting time with unnecessary informations.

### DATA QUERYING
Here I used SQL Server to query my data to  retrieve the total sales for each product category, find the number of sales transactions in each region,find the highest-selling product by total sales value and many more

### DATA VISUALIZATION
I was able to show my data in a visual format making it easy to understand to the owner of the retail store.

### CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 We have been able to see the strength and weaknesses of this retail store through this analysis. We have seen key insights in the sales of the store and see that there is more room for improvement.
 The organisation should try do discover and do a survey on how they can improve their service to their customers.
